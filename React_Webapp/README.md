Running the Back-end:

Open Visual Studio and try to run the API (COTE_Reviews) Project
⇒ If you can’t run the API project from Visual Studio, Open Visual Studio Code from Apps Anywhere which can run it.

In Visual Studio Code via terminal navigate to the Cote_Review API folder and run the backend: 
⇒cd Cote_Review
⇒cd API
 ⇒dotnet watch run

*This will open Swagger in a browser so you know it’s running!

Running the Front-end:

Run Node.JS from Apps Anywhere

Open a new terminal within VS Code and Ensure you are in the COTE-Movies folder

Terminal Commands
cd .. to move back in terminal, dir to show current folders, cd folder_name to change directory to that folder.

Once in the Cote-Movies folder in a terminal, run the following command to install node modules required:

⇒ npm install

Running the Chat Server:

Run the following command from the COTE-Movies folder in a new terminal:

⇒ node src/server/index.js

Now you should have the back-end API running, and the chat server.  Open a new terminal and run the front-end and the full application should now be working.

Run the Front-end via terminal from the COTE-Movies folder, by typing the following:

⇒ npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
